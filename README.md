# 🏡 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project uses **Machine Learning (Linear Regression)** to predict **median house prices** based on multiple numerical and categorical features.  
The goal is to understand how different factors such as rooms, location, and population affect housing prices.

## 📘 Project Overview
This notebook demonstrates how to:
- Load and explore housing data using **Pandas**.
- Preprocess data (handle missing values, encoding, and feature scaling).
- Train and evaluate a **Linear Regression** model.
- Interpret the model using **coefficients** and **R² score**.
- Visualize results using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset includes multiple housing attributes such as:
**crim**
per capita crime rate by town.
**zn**
proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
**indus**
proportion of non-retail business acres per town.
**chas**
Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise).
**nox**
nitrogen oxides concentration (parts per 10 million).
**rm**
average number of rooms per dwelling.
**age**
proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940.
**dis**
weighted mean of distances to five Boston employment centres.
**rad**
index of accessibility to radial highways.
**tax**
full-value property-tax rate per $10,000.
**ptratio**
pupil-teacher ratio by town.
**black**
1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town.
**lstat**
lower status of the population (percent).
**medv**
median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s.
