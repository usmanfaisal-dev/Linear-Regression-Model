# 🏡 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project uses **Machine Learning (Linear Regression)** to predict **median house prices** based on multiple numerical and categorical features.  
The goal is to understand how different factors such as rooms, location, and population affect housing prices.

## 📘 Project Overview
This notebook demonstrates how to:
- Load and explore housing data using **Pandas**.
- Preprocess data (handle missing values, encoding, and feature scaling).
- Train and evaluate a **Linear Regression** model.
- Interpret the model using **coefficients** and **R² score**.
- Visualize results using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset includes multiple housing attributes such as:
- `RM` — average number of rooms per dwelling  
- `LSTAT` — percentage of lower status of the population  
- `PTRATIO` — pupil-teacher ratio by town  
- `MEDV` — median value of owner-occupied homes (target variable)

## Would you like me to:
1. Add a **“Features” section** with bullet points about what the notebook includes (e.g. visualization, RFE, model metrics),  
or  
2. Keep it as is (clean and professional)?
